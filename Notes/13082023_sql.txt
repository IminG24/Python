sql constraints : unique, primary key, foreign key

Primary Key: Uniquely identifies each row in a table, must be unique and not null, only one primary key per table.

Unique Key: Enforces uniqueness, can have multiple unique keys per table, can have NULL values (with the exception of columns that are part of the primary key if they're used in the unique key).

candidate keys -  those can be primary keys
